Using useEffect to fetch live currency data and update the UI dynamically.

Custom Hooks

Creating reusable logic for API calls, loading states, and error handling.

Encapsulating currency conversion logic for cleaner and modular code.

Component-Based Architecture

Designing a modular structure with reusable and maintainable components.

Passing data efficiently between components using props.

Event Handling & User Input

Handling input changes, selection events, and form interactions.

Validating user inputs and updating conversions in real-time.

Conditional Rendering

Displaying loading states, error messages, or conversion results dynamically.

API Integration

Fetching live currency exchange rates from a third-party API.

Handling asynchronous operations and errors gracefully.
